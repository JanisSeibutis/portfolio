# Janis Seibutis - Frontend Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Janis Seibutis, a frontend developer currently studying in a two-year professional education program focused on frontend development and web design.

## About Me

This program teaches the fundamentals of modern frontend development, and a big part of the second year is spent as an intern at a company. During this time, I get to apply my skills in real-world projects while continuing to learn on the job.

I'm driven by a constant desire to learn and improve, and I enjoy exploring new technologies and methods to solve problems. As an intern, I look forward to contributing with enthusiasm and dedication while learning from experienced developers.

In my spare time, I go to the gym, ride my motorcycle, go fishing, and spend time with friends and family.

I am currently looking for an internship. Feel free to reach out to me :)
