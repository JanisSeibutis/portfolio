      <div className="about-content">
      <p>IÂ´m studying frontend development, a 2 year long Higher Vocational Education program that teaches the basics of frontend development and web design. 
        Most of the second year is spent as an intern at a company, where I get to learn and apply my skills in a real-world environment.
        I am driven by a constant desire to 
        learn more and to apply new technologies and methods to solve problems. As an intern, I look forward to learning from your expertise while contributing 
        with my enthusiasm and dedication.
        In my spare time i go to the gym, ride my motorcycle, go fishing and spend time with my friends and family.
